This is a game made for the 2023 Minetest Gamejam.

To start, switch to the game in the main menu.
Then, create a new world with the default settings(you can change the name though).
Press the play button.

When you enter the world, go ahead and look around, mine some blocks, and begin the journey.


If there are any problems, go to the ContentDB page for the game and click on the link
that takes you to the Github page. You can go to "issues" and post your suggestions, bug
reports and crashes in an issue.

Alternatively, you can contact me in the main Minetest discord. My username there is Charleston314(id:charleston314).
